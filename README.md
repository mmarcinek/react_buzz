## Installing Dependencies

will get everything you need to run this application.

Entering `npm start` will compile the application and open your default browser to `localhost:3000` you can use that application, thanks [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### More about dependencies, AKA "What are you installing

1. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
